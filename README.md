# Overall-Profitability-in-Lottery-Gambling
This project was done in the second year of my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering.

Objectives for the Project:

1. Risk Awareness: Increase public awareness about the inherent risks associated with participating in lotteries, including the low probability of winning and the potential for financial loss.
2. Financial Education: Educate individuals about the long-term financial implications of habitual lottery participation, including the likelihood of spending more money on tickets than the expected return.
3. Social Impact Assessment: Examine the social consequences of lottery participation, such as exacerbating economic inequality by disproportionately affecting low-income individuals and contributing to financial 
   hardship among vulnerable populations.
4. Addiction Prevention: Highlight the potential for lottery addiction and its adverse effects on individuals' financial stability, mental health, and relationships. Provide resources and strategies for recognizing 
   and addressing compulsive gambling behaviors.

In this project we have used the following modules:

1. Random : To generate Random numbers for lottery 
2. Pandas : To create a Series object that stores the player names and the associated lottery numbers.
3. Tkinter : To give this program an interactive frontend
4. Matplotlib : To generate graphs to show overall profitability over a period of time
